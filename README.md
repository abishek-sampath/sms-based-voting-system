##Abstract:


The Voting process takes place to select a leader, a representative of the people, who will lead the nation. It is the duty of every eligible citizen to cast their votes in the election process. In the existing systems, voting process is done through paper ballot system. In recent years, electronic voting system was introduced and is being used more and more. Electronic voting system provides convenience and access to the electorate, making the vote backup and counting process a lot quicker and easier. But in these voting systems people have to wait in long queues to cast their votes and also implementing this method is very expensive and time consuming. This is pretty evident from the very low vote outcome percentages every year. This situation is more prevalent in urban city centres and also to an extent in rural areas; the non-voting percentage of citizens find it hard to allocate time to exercise their national duty (for example, IT professionals who would rather go to work to earn extra money, than to wait in long queues). Also, apart from the before mentioned main issue, there are other obliterating problems such as Security issues, vote database constraints, Unwanted crowding and mobs in public places, etc. So, in order to eliminate the issues in the existing voting system we introduce a new system of voting through SMS. The proposed system is highly reliable, secured and cost effective. Any registered individual with any type of mobile phone can use it to cast their votes.


We have a secured method of allocating each individual with a unique ID corresponding to their voter ID and phone number, so that no fraudulent doings can be done. The total proposed system can be integrated along with the existing election process so that higher vote outcome can be achieved among other critical benefits, and in the future, the existing system can be shifted to the proposed one, to completely mobilize the Voting System.
